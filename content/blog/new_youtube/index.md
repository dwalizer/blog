As of today, I've started a YouTube channel for posting gameplay videos from various
consoles, and perhaps later reviews and other content.  This is going to to be directly
tied to a website I'm working on about gaming, to be launched at a later date.

The website, much like this blog, will be running on React using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), so
I'll probably also post some entries on how to get started with React and Gatsby.
